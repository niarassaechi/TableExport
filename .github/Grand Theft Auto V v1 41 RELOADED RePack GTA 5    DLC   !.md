Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most popular and acclaimed open-world games of all time, featuring a vast and diverse map, a rich story mode, and an online multiplayer mode with endless possibilities. However, if you want to enjoy GTA V on your PC with all the latest updates and DLCs, you might need to download a repack version that compresses the game files and makes them easier to install.
 
One of the best repacks available for GTA V is the Grand Theft Auto V v1 41 RELOADED RePack, which is based on the Grand.Theft.Auto.V-RELOADED ISO release[^1^] [^2^]. This repack includes the Grand.Theft.Auto.V.Update.v1.41-RELOADED patch[^1^] [^2^], which adds new content and features to the game, such as new vehicles, weapons, missions, and more. The game version is v1.0.1180.1/1.41 Online[^1^] [^2^], which means you can play online without needing a Social Club account[^1^] [^2^]. All multiplayer and DLC files are untouched and intact, so the repack is completely safe for modding[^1^] [^2^]. The language is Multi11[^1^] [^2^], which means you can choose from 11 different languages to play the game in.

The repack size is 36.3 GB[^1^] [^2^], which is much smaller than the original ISO size of 63.4 GB[^1^] [^2^]. The final size after installation is 72 GB[^1^] [^2^], which is still less than the original size of 83.5 GB[^2^]. The repack is lossless, which means nothing is removed or re-encoded[^1^] [^2^]. The install time is 40-70 minutes[^1^] [^2^], depending on your system specifications and settings. The repack uses Xtool & Lolz by Razor12911 & ProFrager as compression tools[^1^] [^2^].
 
If you want to download and install the Grand Theft Auto V v1 41 RELOADED RePack, you can find it on various torrent sites, such as 1337x, KAT, Rustorka, TPB, Prostylex, ettv, TorrentGalaxy[^2^], or on DODI's official site[^2^]. You will need a torrent client, such as uTorrent or BitTorrent, to download the repack files. After downloading, you will need to mount or burn the ISO file using a tool like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. Then, you will need to run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install the game. Make sure you have enough free space on your drive, disable your antivirus and Windows Defender, use a short path to install (preferably in English), and don't run any other programs while installing. After installation, you can run the game from the desktop shortcut or from the game folder.
