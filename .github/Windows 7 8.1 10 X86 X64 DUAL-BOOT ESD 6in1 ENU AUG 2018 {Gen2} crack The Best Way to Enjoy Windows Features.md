## Step 2: Create a bootable USB or DVD

After downloading Rufus, run it and follow these steps:
 
- Insert your USB flash drive or DVD into your PC.
- Select your USB flash drive or DVD from the Device dropdown menu.
- Click on the Select button and browse to the location of the ISO file.
- Make sure the Partition scheme is set to MBR and the Target system is set to BIOS or UEFI.
- Leave the other options as default and click on Start.
- Wait for Rufus to create the bootable media. This might take several minutes depending on the speed of your USB flash drive or DVD.
- When Rufus is done, you will have a bootable USB or DVD with Windows 7 8.1 10 X86 X64 DUAL-BOOT ESD 6in1 ENU AUG 2018 Gen2 on it.

## Step 3: Install Windows on your PC
 
The final step is to install Windows on your PC using the bootable USB or DVD. You will need to restart your PC and boot from the USB or DVD. You might need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to do this.
 
Once you boot from the USB or DVD, you will see a menu with six options: Windows 7 Home
